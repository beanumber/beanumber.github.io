    "text": "I am a data scientist. Data science is an emerging field commonly described as “the practice of deriving valuable insights from data,” and this thread runs through all of my work. My scholarly contributions have come in five main areas:\nSubfields of interest to me include network science, applied statistics, sabermetrics, sports analytics, statistical modeling, analysis of algorithms, combinatorial optimization, data visualization, graph theory, and combinatorics. My Erdös number is 3, as I have co-authored a paper with Amotz Bar-Noy, who has co-authored a paper with Noga Alon, who has co-authored a paper with Paul Erdős.\nMy background is academically diverse, in that my undergraduate degree is in economics (my first declared major was English), my doctorate is in mathematics, my thesis adviser is in computer science, and my professional experience is in statistics. As such, my research tends to be interdisciplinary, with an emphasis on applying available techniques from any discipline to address the question of interest.\nIn 2012, I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, where my advisor was Amotz Bar-Noy, also of Brooklyn College. Previously, I earned an M.A. in Applied Mathematics from the University of California, San Diego, and a B.A. in Economics from Wesleyan University.\nIn 2019, I won the Significant Contributor Award from the Section on Statistics in Sports of the American Statistical Association.\nDownload my CV Please see my C.V. for complete details on my work."

It equips you with the necessary skills and software tools to perform all the analysis steps, from importing the data to transforming them into an appropriate format to visualizing the data via graphs to performing a statistical analysis.\n Read the 3rd edition\nBuy the book from:\n\nCRC Press\nAmazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern Data Science with R, 2nd edition\nContemporary data science uses both statistical modeling and computer programming to extract meaning from data. It requires a tight integration of knowledge from statistics, computer science, mathematics, and a domain of application. This book, which is intended for readers with some background in statistics and modest prior experience with coding, helps them develop and practice the appropriate skills to tackle complex data science projects. Most of the examples are done in R, but SQL, Python, and other cutting-edge tools are discussed as well.\nRead the:\n\n 2nd edition\n lightly revised 3rd edition\n\nBuy the book from:\n\nCRC Press\nAmazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern Data Science with R cover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sabermetric Revolution cover\n\n\n\n\nThe Sabermetric Revolution\nThe Sabermetric Revolution: Assessing the Growth of Analytics in Baseball, is co-authored with leading sports economist Andrew Zimbalist. We examine the evolution of sabermetrics in baseball and other sports since the publication of Moneyball, summarize the current state of sabermetric thinking, and address the question of whether there is any evidence that sabermetrics has actually worked. The book was published by the University of Pennsylvania Press in 2014.\nBuy the book from:\n\nUPenn Press\nAmazon\nGoogle Books"

    "text": "Baseball has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Like a lot of kids, I played in Little League, collected baseball cards, and practiced switch-hitting while playing Wiffleball in the backyard. I played through high school, and as an adult in men’s leagues on Long Island and in Central Park. Now I play softball in the co-ed division of the Northampton Parks & Recreation department.\nI was lucky enough to work for the New York Mets as their Statistical Analyst for 8.5 years. During that time our department took huge strides in terms of its ability to collect, process, disseminate, and understand statistical data.\nIn 2012, I was selected by the Mets be their representative in the Baseball IQ trivia show on the MLB Network. At stake was up to $45,000 for our chosen charity, Welcome Back Veterans. Here’s how I did in:\n\nRound 1 vs. the Phillies (original air date: January 24th, 2012)\nRound 2 vs. the Braves (original air date: February 14th, 2012)\nQuarterfinals vs. the Cubs (original air date: February 22nd, 2012)\nSemifinals vs. the White Sox (original air date: February 23rd, 2012)\nFinals vs. the Angels (original air date: February 23rd, 2012)\n\nI’ve collected links to some articles in which you will find more information about my work with the Mets."
