    "text": "I was lucky enough to work for the New York Mets as their Statistical Analyst for 8.5 years. During that time our department took huge strides in terms of its ability to collect, process, disseminate, and understand statistical data.\nIn 2012, I was selected by the Mets be their representative in the Baseball IQ trivia show on the MLB Network. At stake was up to $45,000 for our chosen charity, Welcome Back Veterans. Here’s how I did in:\n\nRound 1 vs. the Phillies (original air date: January 24th, 2012)\nRound 2 vs. the Braves (original air date: February 14th, 2012)\nQuarterfinals vs. the Cubs (original air date: February 22nd, 2012)\nSemifinals vs. the White Sox (original air date: February 23rd, 2012)\nFinals vs. the Angels (original air date: February 23rd, 2012)\n\nI’ve collected links to some articles in which you will find more information about my work with the Mets."

My Erdös number is 3, as I have co-authored a paper with Amotz Bar-Noy, who has co-authored a paper with Noga Alon, who has co-authored a paper with Paul Erdös.\nMy background is academically diverse, in that my undergraduate degree is in economics (my first declared major was English), my doctorate is in mathematics, my thesis advisor is in computer science, and my professional experience is in statistics. As such, my research tends to be interdisciplinary, with an emphasis on applying available techniques from any discpline to address the question of interest.\nIn 2012, I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, where my advisor was Amotz Bar-Noy, also of Brooklyn College. Previously, I earned an M.A. in Applied Mathematics from the University of California, San Diego, and a B.A. in Economics from Wesleyan University.\nIn 2019, I won the Significant Contributor Award from the Section on Statistics in Sports of the American Statistical Association.\n: Please see my C.V. for complete details on my work.\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing Baseball Data with R cover\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing Baseball Data with R, 2nd edition\nAnalyzing Baseball Data with R, 2nd Edition introduces R to sabermetricians, baseball enthusiasts, and students interested in exploring the richness of baseball data. It equips you with the necessary skills and software tools to perform all the analysis steps, from importing the data to transforming them into an appropriate format to visualizing the data via graphs to performing a statistical analysis.\nBuy the book from:\n\nCRC Press\nAmazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern Data Science with R, 2nd edition\nContemporary data science uses both statistical modeling and computer programming to extract meaning from data. It requires a tight integration of knowledge from statistics, computer science, mathematics, and a domain of application. This book, which is intended for readers with some background in statistics and modest prior experience with coding, helps them develop and practice the appropriate skills to tackle complex data science projects. Most of the examples are done in R, but SQL, Python, and other cutting-edge tools are discussed as well.\n Read the 2nd edition\nBuy the book from:\n\nCRC Press\nAmazon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern Data Science with R cover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sabermetric Revolution cover\n\n\n\n\nThe Sabermetric Revolution\nSince leaving the Mets, I’ve written a book, entitled The Sabermetric Revolution: Assessing the Growth of Analytics in Baseball, with leading sports economist Andrew Zimbalist. We examine the evolution of sabermetrics in baseball and other sports since the publication of Moneyball, summarize the current state of sabermetric thinking, and address the question of whether there is any evidence that sabermetrics has actually worked. The book will be published by the University of Pennsylvania Press and is scheduled for a December 2013 release.\nBuy the book from:\n\nUPenn Press\nAmazon\nBarnes & Noble\nGoogle Books\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOngoing Projects\n\n\n\n\n\nDSC-WAV\n\n\n\n\nDSC-WAV\nI am the PI on a nine institution, $1.2 million workforce developed project funded by the National Science Foundation.\nThe DSC-WAV project simultaneously addresses two problems: 1) the inability of community-based and non-profit organizations to tackle data science problems; and 2) the lack of real world experience gained by students studying data science.\nThis project addresses both issues by deploying teams of data science students to assist local organizations, thereby increasing the long-term capacity of the data science workforce.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenIntro\nI developed a series of courses on Introductory Statistics with R sequence of courses for DataCamp, an interactive platform to learn R and data science. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel (Duke), Andrew Bray (Reed), and Jo Hardin (Pomona) are working with me on these courses.
